## Write-Up

This challenge included a `enc` file that contains an encrypted file. and when checking description of the challenge as well as the tags, we can conclude that it is encrypted using `caesar` algorithm, more precisely using `rot13`. 

To decrypt it, we can do it by hand, use a pre-defined library or use an online tool. Here is the text after decryption :

```
nice, i hope you know how caesar works now, here is your flag shellmates{caesar_just_rotations}
```

## Flag
